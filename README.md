# MAGNDATASymData
Give DFT high-symmetry point symmetry-data for the magnetic materials as listed in MAGNDATA
Open a Mathematica notebook, and Get["Dir\MAGNDATASymData.wl"], where Dir is the directory containing MAGNDATASymData.wl
Then a table is shown, in which, you are allowed to choose successfully calculated magnetic materials in MAGNDATA by VASP to get high-symmetry point symmetry-data
