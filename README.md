# MAGNDATASymData
This subroutine can give DFT high-symmetry point symmetry-data for the magnetic materials as listed in MAGNDATA

Open a Mathematica notebook, and Get["Dir\MAGNDATASymData.wl"], where Dir is the directory containing MAGNDATASymData.wl

Then a table is shown, in which, you are allowed to choose successfully calculated magnetic materials in MAGNDATA by VASP to get high-symmetry point symmetry-data

Copy the raw data which can be used as ont input of CalTopoEvol
